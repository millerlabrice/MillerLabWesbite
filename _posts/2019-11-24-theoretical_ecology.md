As quantitative population biologists, our lab seeks to understand how populations work. Understanding the demographic processes that determine population growth in nature can be complicated. Our work relies heavily on the development and application of mathematical models, especially structured population models, which allow us to connect individual demography and dispersal to population-level processes.

Research in the lab has built on theory for understand life history, species coexistence, structured populations, and stochastic demography.</p>
