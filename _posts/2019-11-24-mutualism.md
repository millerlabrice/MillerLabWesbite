<strong>Mutualisms, positive interactions between species, are widespread and notoriously context dependent.</strong>

This context dependent nature can shift the direction of these interactions, thereby causing them to become neutral or negative. We consider how multiple mutualistic partners affect host fitness. And how environmnetal context can shift the magnitude and direction of heritable symbiont effects on host fitness. We work with a variety of systems to address these topics. Some of our favorite systems include ants and cacti and heritable fungal endophytes and grasses.
