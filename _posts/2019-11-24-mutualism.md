Mutualisms, positive interactions between species, are widespread and notoriously context dependent.

We work with a variety of systems to address how mutualistic interactions -- and their context-dependent effects -- affect population dynamics. Some of our favorite systems include ants and cacti and fungal endophytes and grasses.
