 We have several projects examing the ecological dynamics of plant-animal and plant-microbe mutualisms. 

<strong>LTREB: Host-microbe symbiosis through the lens of stochastic demography. (NSF-DEB-1754468)</strong>
Microbial symbioses are widespread in nature and notoriously context-dependent, spanning a continuum
from mutualism to parasitism depending on environmental conditions. Most symbioses are subject to
temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions, and this is increasingly the case under global climate
change. This context-dependency means that symbionts may be most beneficial to hosts in bad years but
neutral or even costly in good years. Therefore, in the long term, symbiosis with microbes may reduce
demographic variance in the host. This observation leads to two novel hypotheses that this project is
designed to test. First, since environmental variability generally reduces fitness, symbionts may confer
fitness benefits by buffering hosts against the negative effects of variability. Thus, by reducing variability,
symbiotic microbes may function as mutualists even if their fitness effects are neutral, on average. By
buffering hosts against harsh conditions, symbionts may also limit genetic drift and promote higher
genetic diversity in host populations. Second, hosts with and without symbionts may exhibit different
patterns of temporal fluctuation in their demographic rates, thus promoting the storage effect, a
mechanism that can stabilize competitive coexistence in stochastic environments. Under this second
hypothesis, fluctuations in context may promote the coexistence of symbiotic and symbiont-free hosts,
potentially explaining the ‘mixtures’ of host types that are widely observed in a diversity of plant and
animal symbioses. The PIs will test these hypotheses using a unique, long-term field experiment in which
plant populations were established with or without vertically transmitted fungal symbionts, replicated
across seven host-symbiont pairs. Building on nine years of demographic data and leveraging a
hierarchical Bayesian analytical framework, the decadal plan will allow the PIs to (1) quantify and
compare the effects of symbiosis on host fitness via reductions in demographic variance versus effects on
mean demographic performance, and (2) test the contributions of the storage effect to the coexistence of
hosts with and without symbionts, relative to competing mechanisms that do not rely on environmental
variability. Identifying climate drivers of inter-annual variability will allow for the extrapolation of
inferences to novel climate regimes, including climate change forecasted for the study regions. Finally,
proposed work will identify host and symbiont traits that correlate with the effects of symbionts on host
fitness, genetic diversity, and coexistence, thus generalizing results beyond the focal taxa.

<strong>Consequences of partner diversity and turnover in an ant-plant mutualism</strong>
We also study ant-plant defensive mutualisms and the drivers and consequences of partner diversity in ant-plant systems. Much of this work is based in the tree cholla cactus system, in which we have been tracking ant associations with this extrafloral nectar-bearing plant since 2003. Past work has demonstrated variation in partner quality and the guild of cactus-tending ants (Miller 2007, Ohm and Miller 2014) and how the quantity and quality of extrafloral nectar influence ant partner identity and defense. Our new questions are focused on turnover between alternative ant parterns and whether climate change will disrupt or strengthen this mutualism.
