title: Range Expansion

<h3>Dispersal is a key demographic process that links disparate populations and communities, and that influences species ranges.</h3> Invasive species and climatically driven range shifts are two of the most pressing problems in ecology. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin these range expansions is a central goal of the lab. 

Recent and current work on range expansions explores how climate may drive shifts in vegetation ecotones across natural landscapes at the Sevillita National Wildlife Refuge, how climate mediates species interactions across ranges, and how evolution can modify dispersal ability using bean beetle populations in the lab.
